I wrote LEECHES to highlight the practice of contract marriages in communities so disadvantaged that they have allowed themselves to mask what is blatantly a sex-slave trade behind the veil of acceptable religious ritual.",
"p2" : "In Hyderabad’s old city, rich businessmen prey on the virginity of underage girls in an archaic practice that is still propagated under the auspices of Islamic marriage laws, which allow a man to have four wives at a time. These men take brides for short periods, sometimes just a night, with rates varying according to the duration of the marriage, leading to the nickname 'one-day bride'. An intricate web of opportunists facilitate this flesh trade, including many clerics, who work for clients with a predilection for teenage-virgin brides.",

"p3" : "I came across this practice while living in the city two years ago, thereafter researching the facts through Shaheen, an NGO that helps girls who run away from such arrangements, forced upon them by desperate or greedy families.", 
"p4" : "I chose the character of Raisa as the protagonist because she represents the great courage of spirit possessed by girls who refuse to accept these sham marriages as their fate.  Regardless of Raisa’s fate in the film, her actions bring hope to a dark reality. With his film, it is my aim to capture the frenetic, terrifying energy of the old city & the desperation of its people, set against the timelessness of the Charminar, a metaphor for Raisa’s eternal sacrifice in the film."
