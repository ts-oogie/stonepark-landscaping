            <p> Hello there. This is the second update from the Stonepark Beautification committee. 
                The committee has continued documenting removals, repairs, and designs for the ongoing
                beautification project. As mentioned in the previous update, a web based app was created hoping to encourage individual engagement from committee members. The app went live and was temporarily hosted <a href="https://beautify-stonepark-f8af732df93d.herokuapp.com/#/" target="blank">here</a>. The app is not mobile-friendly, at this time it only works on a desktop or laptop computer.</p>
                <p>We would like to invite all committee members to post any items to the app that need attention. If you would like a tutorial on how to use the application, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:beautifystonepark@gmail.com">beautifystonepark@gmail.com</a> and we would give you a walkthrough on how to post items to the project taskboard.</p>
             </p>
            <p>    This past week, committee focused on areas around buildings 7000 and 9000. Some of the issues found were as follows :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found an area in front of building 7000 in need of grading to prevent water from pooling</li>
                <li>Identified several trees around buildings in need of removal.</li>
                <li>Identified several tree stumps in need of removal.</li>
                <li>Tripping hazards including exposed tree roots and pavers were noted.</li>
                <li>A large tree not within close proximity to either building was marked for removal in order to increase the availability of sunlight in a high visibile area suitable for beautification.</li>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : The need to remove smaller plants and weeds growing underneath bushes.</li>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : The need to eliminate twigs, pinecones, and leaves scattered throughout.</li>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : Please stop blowing leaves behind bushes and hvac units.</li>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : Make sure all bushes are trimmed. Several were found to be untrimmed. Provide spacing between bush and building wall. Height of bushes shall not exceed the lower window sill.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>    We have decided to bring Scott with ING Landscaping on board as an advisor to help the committee with design and planning decisions. Scott has over two decades of experience with landscaping with his own company and has been very generous in sharing his knowledge with us.</p>
            <p>    The web app was shared with the chair of the Grounds committee and they are looking into incorporating it into their committee. Additional features were added to the app including layers that show existing grass and shade locations and a legend identifying symbols.</p>
            <p>    Committee members who would like to have their design sketches prettified into professional looking graphics can email their drawings to <a href="mailto:beautifystonepark@gmail.com">beautifystonepark@gmail.com</a></p>
