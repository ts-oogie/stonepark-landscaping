            <p> Hello there. This is another update from the Stonepark Beautification committee. We will try to send out these status reports on a regular basis to keep everyone posted on our progress. We have been trying to play catch up since a lack of participation in this group has resulted in the committee falling behind the others.
                However within the past couple of weeks, the committee has caught up by starting the process of documentating removal, repair, and design items.</p><p> In the previous update, we introduced a web based app that was created to help members document and post their findings on a centralized taskboard. The app went live and is being hosted <a href="https://beautify-stonepark-f8af732df93d.herokuapp.com/#/" target="blank">here</a>. The app is not mobile-friendly, at this time it only works on a desktop or laptop computer.</p>
             
            <p>    This past week, committee focused on areas around buildings 7000 and 9000. Some of the issues found were as follows :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found an area in front of building 7000 in need of grading to prevent water from pooling</li> <br/>
                <li>Identified several trees around buildings in need of removal.</li> <br/>
                <li>Identified several tree stumps in need of removal.</li> <br/>
                <li>Tripping hazards including exposed tree roots and pavers were noted.</li> <br/>
                <li>A large tree not within close proximity to either building was marked for removal in order to increase the availability of sunlight in a high visibile area suitable for beautification.</li> <br/>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : The need to remove smaller plants and weeds growing underneath bushes.</li> <br/>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : The need to eliminate twigs, pinecones, and leaves scattered throughout.</li> <br/>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : Please stop blowing leaves behind bushes and hvac units.</li> <br/>
                <li>Deficiency in the quality of services provided by Landmark Landscaping : Make sure all bushes are trimmed. Several were found to be untrimmed. Provide spacing between bush and building wall. Height of bushes shall not exceed the lower window sill.</li> <br/>
            </ul>
            <p>    We have been turning to Scott with IMG Landscaping for help with design and planning decisions. Scott has over two decades of experience with landscaping with his own company and has been very generous in sharing his knowledge with us.</p>
            <p>We would like to invite all committee members to post any items to the app that need attention. If you would like a tutorial on how to use the application, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:beautifystonepark@gmail.com">beautifystonepark@gmail.com</a> and we would give you a walkthrough on how to post items to the project taskboard via online or in person. The colored dots on the map are items that have already been posted. The legend on the right hand side identifies and names each symbol being used and there are two buttons for toggling the grass and shade layers. </p> <p>We are mainly focusing on safety or repair issues like removing trees that are within 6'-8' of the building, tripping hazards, areas that require grading due to pooling water next to building foundations, irrigation repair issues, and pointing out deficiencies in the quality of work provided by the current landscapers. Some of the deficiencies include untrimmed bushes, small plants and weeds growing underneath bushes, debris (twigs, leaves, and pinecones) behind bushes and hvac and debris scattered on lawns. </p> <p>If you would like to submit design sketchs for landscaping ideas feel free to, however be mindful that when tree removals take place it may change the amount of sunlight that particular area receives after the trees are removed.</p>

            <p>    The web app was shared with the chair of the Grounds committee and they are looking into incorporating it into their committee. Additional features were added to the app including layers that show existing grass and shade locations and a legend identifying symbols.</p>
            <p>    Committee members who would like to have their design sketches *prettified into professional looking graphics can email their drawings to <a href="mailto:beautifystonepark@gmail.com">beautifystonepark@gmail.com</a></p>
